# Upload-Multiple-Images-With-Base_64-In-React-Native
This module will allow user to upload multiple images through mobile device camera and it's gallery both built with React Native Expo. This project is divided in three parts. 
1. Uploading multiple images by selecting from the gallery propertie of any mobile device.
2. Uploading image by clicking photo through accessing the camera of mobile device.
3. Converting image into Base64 encoding.
   - Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format. This is useful when the storage or delivery medium    does not support binary data such as when embedding an image into a database, CSS files or HTML. One must be careful to not mix up compression with encoding.
